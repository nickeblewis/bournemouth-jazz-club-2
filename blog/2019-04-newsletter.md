__Friday 12 April__ It is with deep sadness and regret that I have to report
the death of Terry Webb, our Secretary/Treasurer in Bournemouth
Hospital this morning. Members who attended our meeting on Wednesday
will know that Derek Fones did, in fact, tell us about Terry’s quite rapid
decline in health. Nonetheless, this has still come as a shock to me
personally and John Savage, our Chairman. This is not the time and
place to speak about and honour our good friend and jazz lover. That
will definitely come at another time.

The Chairman welcomed 18 attendees to the meeting. Apologies for absence: Terry & Evelyne Webb;
Freda Smith

* Answers to March Newsletter quiz question: Q: What was the last album Freddie Green appeared
on? He died a week after recording it.
* A: Diane Schuur & The Count Basie Orchestra recorded Feb 25 1987. She was awarded a Grammy
for the album in 1958. Basie died in 1984.

And finally …….. have you heard this quote?

“If jazz has to be termed as a wave, then music is a sea, but if the reflectors in the water is
the chord” - _Thelonious Monk_

or, a quiz question:

Q: What group is in the opening titles of the 1958 film ‘Jazz on a Summer’s
Day’ What tune are they playing?

The Chairman closed the meeting at 9.50 wishing everyone A Safe Journey Home.
