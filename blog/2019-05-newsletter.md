As you may know, I was involved in the selection of music played at Terry
Webb’s funeral. I also put together a CD of that music plus selections from his
past presentations to the club to play at the gathering afterwards. Phil
Washington asked me to make him a copy. If any other member would like a
copy, please let me know and I will bring them to the next meeting. We will
charge £3 to go to club funds if that’s OK with you all.

__PLEASE REMEMBER – Our next meeting is on Weds 12 June__

NB A reminder to all that if you would like to nominate a member for the post of
