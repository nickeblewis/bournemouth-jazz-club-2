The Programme Secretary, Vic Grayson, welcomed 19 members and 2 guests to the Inaugural August
Meeting with a quote from the seminal Duke Ellington autobiography - ‘Music Is My Mistress’. Most
pleasingly, one of the guests, Jackie Leevers (daughter of our Chairman), has become a member.
The Chairman then welcomed and introduced Chris Walker, our guest presenter, to the meeting.
