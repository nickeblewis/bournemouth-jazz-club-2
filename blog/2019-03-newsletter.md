PLEASE REMEMBER – Our next meeting is on April 10 and is both the Club AGM AND
a ‘You’re On!” session (bring your own CD). *** I’m issuing a challenge to members –
can you find an interesting/exciting track that also includes either ‘stop-time or
‘double-time’? Obviously, it’s not compulsory but I’ll give a small prize to what I think
is the best.

And finally …….. have you heard this one?

Have you heard about the chap who was so dim his teacher gave him two sticks
and he became a drummer but then he lost one and became a conductor.
and a quiz question:

Q: What was the last album Freddie Green appeared on? He died a week after recording it..

The Chairman closed the meeting at 9.45 wishing everyone A Safe Journey Home.
